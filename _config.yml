      text:
        "<b>The purpose of the meeting</b> is to discuss the status of experimental and theoretical works on suprathermal electrons and ions in a wide variety of magnetic confinement geometries. The meeting will cover the formation and transportation of energetic particles, including their confinement properties. It will also provide a detailed account of the location of lost energetic particle incidence on first wall components, the collective instabilities they drive, their impact on plasma properties in different operational scenarios, and energetic particles diagnostics. It will aim, in particular, at identifying open physics issues and gaps associated with energetic particles in ITER and future fusion power plants. <br><br>
        A Special Edition of refereed journal articles will be published in Nuclear Fusion* <br><br>
        *Subject to anticipated approval by the Editorial Board

aboutUs: "The Plasma Science and Fusion Technology (PSFT) Group at the University of Seville aims at making fusion energy a reality for our society. A clean, sustainable and virtually unlimited energy source makes fusion the scientific and engineering challenge of the 21st century. The PSFT group seeks to answer some of the most important questions on the fusion energy quest. Based on cutting-edge technologies and state-of-the-art numerical codes, we aim at getting a better understanding of energetic particle and plasma edge physics; key areas in the development of a high confinement, self maintained burning plasma. The development of new diagnostics and experimental approaches for the most relevant experimental fusion reactors worldwide form the basis of our research. The PSFT research mission is completed with the training of the new generation of fusion scientists and engineers."
